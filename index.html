                <h1>Dearest Angel,</h1>
                <p>I hope this finds you well.</p>




 
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">I know you said if i pulled another stunt like that, you're out</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">but this wasnt like that 😁, so am entitled to you hearing me out</p>






                <p>I wanted to address our recent conversation. While I stand by what I said, I realize that my delivery was a bit less than graceful. Just because I prefer to keep things straight-up doesn’t mean I should just blurt out my thoughts like that.</p>
                <p>  <span style="font-weight: 600;">  You frustrate me at times😡</span>, and I admit that sometimes you bring out a side of me that I try to keep under wraps😤. I like being the cool, calm person,   <span style="font-weight: 600;"> but when you say you prefer keeping quiet when there's an issue, I find this extremely selfish of you</span>, and this makes me behave in an uncool way. It’s not an excuse, but I hope you can understand that I was just trying to help you see things from my point of view, but the delivery was off.</p>
                <span style="font-weight: 600;">I know I frustrate you too, and for that, I’m sorry😊!  </span>
                
                <p>But maybe we’re just two pieces of the same puzzle that fit together, frustrations and all.😉</p>
                <p>My intention was never to hurt you or make you feel attacked. After all, a little finesse never hurt anyone!😌</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">All i want is you to "Communicate",  just that</p>
                <p></p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600; font-style: italic;">For example you were to come this week but something came up, all i want is you to tell me 'Hey, something came up naeza kosa kumake ju A and B happened' , but you always choose to just shut up its just infuriating considering our age</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Anyways, Looking forward to you unblocking me 😂, I guess frustrating each other is part of the job</p>
                <p>Best regards,<br>M.K</p>
