                <h1>Dearest Angel,</h1>
                <p>I hope this finds you well.</p>
                <p>I wanted to address our recent conversation. While I stand by what I said, I realize that my delivery was a bit less than graceful. Just because I prefer to keep things straight-up doesnâ€™t mean I should just blurt out my thoughts like that.</p>
                <p>You frustrate me at timesðŸ˜¡, and I admit that sometimes you bring out a side of me that I try to keep under wrapsðŸ˜¤. I like being the cool, calm person, but when you say you prefer keeping quiet when there's an issue, I find this extremely selfish of you, and this makes me behave in an uncool way. Itâ€™s not an excuse, but I hope you can understand that I was just trying to help you see things from my point of view, but the delivery was off.</p>
                <p>I know I frustrate you too, and for that, Iâ€™m sorryðŸ˜Š! But maybe weâ€™re just two pieces of the same puzzle that fit together, frustrations and all.ðŸ˜‰</p>
                <p>My intention was never to hurt you or make you feel attacked. After all, a little finesse never hurt anyone!ðŸ˜Œ</p>
                <p>Looking forward to you unblocking me ðŸ˜‚</p>
                <p>Best regards,<br>M.K</p>
